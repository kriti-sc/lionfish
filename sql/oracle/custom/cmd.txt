/*

Here you can place your custom SQL which will be executed by Lionfish
and the result stored in JSON file. The goal is to help you to export statements
from your log table, etc.

IMPORTANT: Only files with ".sql" extensions will be read by Lionfish,
so please rename this file if you want it not to be ignored!

SQL result set must have 5 columns which will be filled in order into
"sourceCode", "name", "groupName", "database" and "schema" fields of objects
in the "queries" JSON array.

You can place special placholder "##DBNAME##" which will be replaced
with the name of currently extracted database, see example below.

Example:
*/

SELECT
 'create table foo as select bar from dual' AS SOURCECODE,
 'foo_table' AS NAME,
 'example' AS GROUPNAME,
 '##DBNAME##' AS DATABASENAME,
 'baz' AS SCHEMANAME
FROM dual
